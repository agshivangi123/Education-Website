                and comes in many forms. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public
                schools. Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling system
                while informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal
                education are divided into levels that include early childhood education, primary education, secondary
                education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like
                teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on the subject, like science education, language
                education, and physical education. The term "education" can also refer to the mental states and
                qualities of educated people and the academic field studying educational phenomena.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The term "education" is derived from the Latin words educare, meaning
                "to bring up" and educere, meaning "to bring forth".[1] The definition of education has been explored by
                theorists from various fields.[2] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving
                goals like the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.[3] There is extensive debate
                regarding its exact nature beyond these general features. One approach views education as a process that
                occurs during events such as schooling, teaching, and learning.[4] Another outlook understands education
                not as a process but as the mental states and dispositions of educated persons that result from this
                process.[5] Additionally, the term may also refer to the academic field that studies the methods,
                processes, and social institutions involved in teaching and learning.[6] Having a clear idea of what the
                term means matters when trying to identify educational phenomena, measure educational success, and
                improve educational practices.[7]</p>
